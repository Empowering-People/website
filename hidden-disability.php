            <p>
                Not all disabilities are visible - some are not obvious, and can make everyday life demanding for many people. In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability, 80% of which have a hidden disability. Hidden disabilities are a wide range of physical and mental conditions that are not visible or immediately obvious. They are also known as "neurodiversities" and can range from a speech impediment, reduced sight, bipolar, chronic fatigue syndrome, colitis, autism, ADHD, depression, among many others.

            <p>
                "Neurodiversity" is a term coined in the 1980s by Australian Sociologist Judy Singer. It is a term used to describe a range of neurological differences and many hidden disabilities including (but not limited to):
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
                <li>Dyslexia</li>
                <li>Dyspraxia</li>
                <li>Dyscalculia</li>
                <li>ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
                <li>ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
                These conditions often co-occur and many symptoms can overlap. There are many strengths in neurodiversity and hidden disabilities.

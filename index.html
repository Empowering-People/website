                Our dedicated mentors will undertake an in-depth interview with
                each possible candidate to fully understand their disabilities,
                ambition and capabilities.

                We will then work to find the perfect employment/role placement
                and only once both employer & employee are happy, will we agree
                on the required support and commence the funding application.

                A tailored support plan will be developed specific to the
                candidate's needs and ensure a job coach is in place that
                understands both the candidate and the process, holding regular
                meetings with both parties to ensure development is on track and
                the candidate's welfare is being prioritised.

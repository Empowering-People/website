        To whomever has the job of maintaining this site when I'm gone:

        This version of the Empowering People website came about in early 2026,
        shortly after my tenure as social media manager began. One of my many
        tasks was editing and maintaining the company's existing website, which
        was created using a site builder. Due to my general disdain for site
        builders, as well as the particular one that was in use giving me a ton
        of grief (couldn't get custom favicon to work, stylesheet just wouldn't
        load in a lot of the time, they put direct modification of the code
        behind a paywall, etc), I decided that it was a far better use of my
        time writing an entirely new website from scratch, and convincing Jodi
        to switch to that one, as even though the initial process of getting
        the site laid out would take some time, once it was ready, I could make
        modifications a lot faster, have more control, and knew for a fact that
        less things would break less often for reasons out of my control.

        Now that the site actually exists and is entirely laid out, modifying it is easy enough:

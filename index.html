                    Our dedicated mentors will undertake an in-depth interview
                    with each possible candidate to fully understand their
                    disabilities, ambition and capabilities.

                    We will then work to find the perfect employment/role
                    placement and only once both employer & employee are happy,
                    will we agree on the required support and commence the
                    funding application.

                    A tailored support plan will be developed specific to the
                    candidate's needs and ensure a job coach is in place that
                    understands both the candidate and the process, holding
                    regular meetings with both parties to ensure development is
                    on track and the candidate's welfare is being prioritised.

# Empowering People Scotland - Company Website
## NOTE: This site is currently a work in progress, and isn't currently being hosted. The version of the site that is currently hosted under our domain is the site-builder version that is going to eventually be replaced by this one.

This is the website for Empowering People Scotland, a company that assists people with disabilities in finding employment, therefore this website is designed with accessibility in mind. If you've come across this repo and want to copy some of the accessibility features we've included in the design of this website, even if you're full on copy pasting our exact code into your project, go right ahead, we want you to, and actively encourage you to, we want to see more websites implementing these kinds of features.

        <h2 class="section-title">Our Goals</h2>
        <p>
            To enable individuals with hidden disabilities to have independence,
            find employment, and empower them to live their best life.<br />
            <br />
            To help people and organisations fully understand what it means to
            work as an individual or employ an individual with a hidden
            disability.

        <h2 class="section-title">Our Promise</h2>
        <p>
            As an organisation with a focused goal of supporting adults with
            learning and social disabilities, our promise is to help people make
            their way in championing an independent and fulfilling life.<br />
            <br />
            We deliver this promise through bespoke plans, tailored to an
            individual's specific needs, helping them to define what
            independence looks like for them, while working to understand their
            personal goals, ambitions, and enable them to achieve the best
            possible chance of success.

            "For me, the significance of the "Autistic Spectrum" lies in its
            call for and anticipation of a "Politics of Neurodiversity". The
            Neurologically Different" represent a new addition to the familiar
            political categories of class/gender/race and will augment the
            insights of the Social Model of Disability."

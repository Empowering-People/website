                I do many things here, I manage Empowering People's variety of
                social media accounts, I film, photograph, and edit media for
                the company, I compose music to put in the background of social
                media posts, and I code and maintain this website.<br />
                <br />
                <!-- And I only get minimum wage :/ -->
                I have a HND in Digital Film and Television, I have years of
                experience messing about with custom websites, and I have years
                of experience making incredibly mediocre music.

    <h2 style="width: 80%; margin: auto">About Empowering People</h2>
    <p>
        Empowering People was formed for one simple reason; To enable
        individuals with additional support needs and hidden disabilities to
        find employment and secure the correct support (both personally and
        professionally), and empower them to live their best lives.<br />
        <br />
        Our founding members have lived with disabilities and know first hand
        some of the many challenges in living a fulfilling life. Our 3 key
        milestones are –
        <b>Understanding, Ambition & Enablement</b>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4 style="width: 80%; margin: auto">So what does that all mean?</h4>
    <p>
        Through developing a clear understanding of what independence looks like
        for our candidates, we work with them to achieve their personal goals
        and ambitions, through bespoke support plans which are tailored to their
        specific needs.

<div class="content-container-beige">
    <h4 style="width: 80%; margin: auto">Why Empowering People?</h4>
    <p>
        Diversity, Inclusion, and Equality are hugely important to our team. We
        want to ensure that we represent the very best interests of each and
        every individual we support.<br />
        <br />
        Our team reflects the diversity of our candidates and employers, and the
        many communities and markets where we work. We strive to understand,
        value, and incorporate differences that are woven into our culture. It
        is a journey we are taking with each new candidate and with each new
        team member.

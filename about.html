            About Empowering People
        </h2>
        <p>
            Empowering People was formed for one simple reason; To enable
            individuals with additional support needs and hidden disabilities to
            find employment and secure the correct support (both personally and
            professionally), and empower them to live their best lives.<br />
            <br />
            Our founding members have lived with disabilities and know first
            hand some of the many challenges in living a fulfilling life. Our 3
            key milestones are –
            <b>Understanding, Ambition & Enablement</b>.

        <h3 class="section-title size-h4">So what does that all mean?</h3>
        <p>
            Through developing a clear understanding of what independence looks
            like for our candidates, we work with them to achieve their personal
            goals and ambitions, through bespoke support plans which are
            tailored to their specific needs.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Diversity, Inclusion, and Equality are hugely important to our team.
            We want to ensure that we represent the very best interests of each
            and every individual we support.<br />
            <br />
            Our team reflects the diversity of our candidates and employers, and
            the many communities and markets where we work. We strive to
            understand, value, and incorporate differences that are woven into
            our culture. It is a journey we are taking with each new candidate
            and with each new team member.

                    Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism. I've been working at
                    The Hub Auckley for nearly two years now."<br />
                    <br />
                    "Since then I have developed many new skills, undertaken
                    some training involved through the employment and been able
                    to work as part of a team by working front of house, and
                    sometimes back of house."<br />
                    <br />
                    "They all love me for who I am, as I've been told by some of
                    them, making the customers feel a lot more welcome when they
                    arrive and they all seem to like my service, by making them
                    laugh and making them feel more comfortable."<br />
                    <br />
                    "I've been getting along with everybody, making many new
                    friends, they all love me for who I am."

                    there, telling me about them wanting their food
                    photographed, and a few weeks later there was a job

                    giving me the hours I wanted."<br />

                    again with my Hub family. Working here has given me
                    confidence to do lots more stuff, and has helped my

        <p>
            Not all disabilities are visible - some are not obvious, and can
            make everyday life demanding for many people. In the UK, 1 in 5
            people have a disability, 80% of which have a hidden disability.
            Hidden disabilities are a wide range of physical and mental
            conditions that are not visible or immediately obvious. They are
            also known as "neurodiversities" and can range from a speech
            impediment, reduced sight, bipolar, chronic fatigue syndrome,
            colitis, autism, ADHD, depression, among many others.

        <p>
            "Neurodiversity" is a term coined in the 1980s by Australian
            Sociologist Judy Singer. It is a term used to describe a range of
            neurological differences and many hidden disabilities including (but
            not limited to):

        <ul class="content-list">
            <li>Dyslexia</li>
            <li>Dyspraxia</li>
            <li>Dyscalculia</li>
            <li>ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
            <li>ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            These conditions often co-occur and many symptoms can overlap. There
            are many strengths in neurodiversity and hidden disabilities.

            If you've noticed a problem with our website, whether it be a simple
            typo, or an accessibility shortfall, or something completely
            different, please don't inform us of it by email or phone, instead
            submit an issue to
            <a
                href="https://github.com/empowering-people/website"
                target="_blank"
                >our website's GitHub repository.</a
            >
            This allows us to better keep track of these things, and
            substantially lessens the likelihood that your concerns get lost
            among other emails we receive.

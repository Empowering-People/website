        Empowering you to help improve our site
    </h1>
    <p>
        Noticed a typo somewhere? Or maybe we've missed something in terms of
        accessibility. Or perhaps it's something completely different.
        Regardless of what it is, we empower you to directly contribute to our
        website!<br />
        <br />
        This site's code is fully open source and publicly viewable on our
        <a href="https://github.com/empowering-people/website" target="_blank"
            >GitHub.</a
        >
        If you have anything you would want to open a discussion, issue, or pull
        request about, no matter how small or trivial it may seem, it's all
        welcome, and will not go disregarded by us. It doesn't matter if you're
        an experienced web developer suggesting sweeping changes to our site's
        entire codebase, or someone who doesn't know the first thing about
        coding, simply making a suggestion or letting us know about an error we
        made.<br />
        <br />
        Note that contributing is entirely voluntary, you don't have to if you
        don't want to, and if you do, you shouldn't expect any more in return
        than a contributor credit thanking you and linking to your GitHub
        account (of course, if you don't want to be credited, all you have to do
        is say so).

    <h1 class="section-title">The technical details</h1>
    <p>
        This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, and uses Jekyll, on top of vanilla
        HTML, CSS, and JS, so familiarity with these is preferred if you're
        wanting to make direct changes to our code, though new developers are
        naturally welcome.<br />
        <br />
        When it comes to JS, we aim to rely on it as little as possible, for a
        few reasons:
    </p>
    <ul class="content-list">
        <li>
            If someone viewing this site is blocking JS in their browser, it
            won't break things too badly.
        </li>
        <li>Minimal JS means faster loading times than many other websites.</li>
        <li>
            Smaller amounts of JS are more easily audited by those concerned
            about the code they're letting run in their browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gabriel Sykes, the Empowering People employee who maintains this
            website, hates working with JS and would rather keep it to small
            amounts of "set it and forget it" code where it is absolutely
            necessary to make something work (like the dyslexia-friendly font
            toggle).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <br />
        Familiarity with Git is also advised, as this site makes heavy use of it
        for version control, and is hosted on a service provided by GitHub.

    <h1 class="section-title">Learning resources</h1>
    <p>
        If you want to learn how to write code for this website, or perhaps even
        create your own website using the same methods we used for ours, here
        are some great resources, recommended personally by the maintainer of
        this site, Gabriel Sykes:<br />
        <br />
        For learning HTML, CSS, and JS:
        <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, an
        excellent free resource for learning various web development tools and
        general programming languages. I've been learning from W3Schools since I
        was 13, and to this day it hasn't failed me.<br />
        <br />
        For learning Jekyll:
        <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/" target="_blank"
            >Jekyll's own documentation</a
        >
        served me very well. This is the first website I have ever used Jekyll
        on, I barely knew it existed until very recently, and within a day their
        documentation was well written enough to get me from knowing nothing to
        knowing enough to do what I needed it to do for this website. I couldn't
        be happier with it.<br />
        <br />
        For learning Git: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
